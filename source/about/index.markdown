My name is Fabio Berger and I am Duke Senior studying CS. I co-founded [ShelfRelief.com](http://shelfrelief.com/ "ShelfRelief") my sophomore year, [WealthLift.com](http://wealthlift.com/ "WealthLift") my junior year and have been working on the [Dubbit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubbit/id713615919?mt=8/ "Dubbit") iOS app this past semester.

Originally from Switzerland, I have also lived in the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, US and Germany. I speak French, Portuguese, Spanish, German and English and love to travel.
