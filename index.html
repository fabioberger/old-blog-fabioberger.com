  <div class="entry-content"><p>Coinbase is a terrific Bitcoin Hosted Wallet that continues to simplify the purchase and safe storage of Bitcoin. They have an extensive API that allows 3rd party developers to build apps ontop of their platform. I noticed they didn&rsquo;t have an API wrapper written in Go, so I decided to write one. In this post, I will show you how to write a simple app using both their API Key and OAuth methods of authentication.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/../images/coinbase.png" width="380" height="120"></p>

<p>The library is hosted on Github <a href="https://github.com/fabioberger/coinbase-go">here</a> together with a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/fabioberger/coinbase-go/#examples">list of examples</a>, detailing the many API calls it supports.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a year ago I was watching South Park and realized how hilarious the show was despite the simplicity of the animations. I then started to think about how many more funny stories could be told if anyone could make an animation, not just the handful of people at South Park Studios. I decided to find out and began building Dubbit, an animated cartoon creator app together with Soroush Pour. After we threw in a month or two of work, it was starting to come together and we launched a minimally viable product with a bare bones feature set to the Apple app store and the cartoons started pouring in from all around the world!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/../images/dubbit_screen1.png" width="550" height="268"></p>

<p>It was again one of those awesome builder moments when you release what you have been working on for a while and see people using it for the first time. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently was dealing with a JSON object returned from an external API. I wanted to decode the JSON object into Golang structs so that I could then process and store its contents in my application. Go has a nifty <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/">JSON Package</a> that makes this process very easy by using the Unmarshal function that takes both the JSON and a pointer to a holder struct into which it is to be decoded.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="nx">err</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">json</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Unmarshal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// b must contain valid JSON that fits into m</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is very straightforward when dealing with JSON objects that contain objects or array of objects. But what if the API returns an array of arrays? In this case, you will need to unmarshal the JSON into a struct containing an array of arrays of either a specific type (i.e string) or an empty interface (i.e interface{}). As an example, if the API returns the following JSON: </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past month I have been spending lots of my time researching cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin and Stellar. After having read multiple whitepapers, manually generating and executing bitcoin transactions on the blockchain and speaking with many of the thought leaders in the space including: <a href="http://www.coinbase.com/about">Fred Ehrsam</a>, <a href="https://www.stellar.org/about/">Joyce Kim</a> and <a href="http://gendal.wordpress.com/about/">Richard Gendal Brown</a>, I am more convinced then ever before that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and will revolutionize the way our world works. In this post, I want to share with you two of the fundamental realizations that have lead me to this conclusion and also some hurdles that are already slowing down the expansion of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2>Permissionless Financial Participation</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In august 2012, Soroush and I returned to school after having worked on WealthLift.com full-time for a year. One of our mentors told us to write down all the lessons we had learned from working on WealthLift. I am very thankful that I took the time to do it, and this is what I wrote. It&rsquo;s not the most organised brain dump, but there are some real gems in here that have now become part of my DNA as a founder.</p>

<h2>1. Your Business Partner is Everything</h2>

<h3>Pick someone you respect in both a personal and professional way</h3>

<p>You will have arguments and bickering. It&rsquo;s really important that you both completely respect one another. Respect each other to tell the truth, even when its  unpleasant, and also enough to judge and weigh each others ideas and arguments with an even hand. </div>

<p>After discovering upon Gael&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.inmoov.fr/" title="InMoov Project">InMoov Project</a>, I decided to start building the InMoov Humanoid Robot. It&rsquo;s been an extremely great learning experience and by far the largest hardware project I have ever undertaken. There were so many lessons learned from this project and so I wanted to share them here with you. Below is a video of the arm Soroush, Alex, Doug and I were able to build within 2 months.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Birth</h2>

<p>Until this point in time, the development of humanoid robotics has taken place in the R&amp;D centers of large organizations. The reason for this has been the extraordinary cost of the hardware, software and collaboration tools at their disposal. Let&rsquo;s face it, a humanoid robot is an incredibly complex piece of engineering. Every joint, every muscle, not to mention the myriad of cognitive functions that are to be reproduced in a semi-intelligible robot are overwhelming. In order to tackle this challenge, I believe the only way to successfully do so is to tap into the ingenuity of the masses, to enable mass collaboration like that which has never before been possible.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/../images/inmoov.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<p>We are about to enter into an era of unprecedented collaboration. The open source movement which began in the obscure corners of the internet, on IRC channels and email-lists is getting exponentially better at enabling people to find interesting projects, contribute with minimal additional effort and most importantly, is no longer limited to software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently started hacking my Raspberry Pi, and as someone who feels most at home in software, I was delighted to find myself controlling hardware components over an SSH connection and having the entirety of the web at my disposal.</p>

<p>I decided to build a simple project that would use a Grove Ultrasound sensor I had bought. I decided on controlling the brightness of an LED by moving my hand up and down above the ultrasound sensor. To do this, I started with the <a href="https://github.com/yexiaobo-seeedstudio/Grove-RaspberryPi" title="Grove Ultrasound sensor github">Grove Ultrasound Sensor python code</a> off Github as well as a <a href="http://marks-space.com/2013/09/23/software-pwm-on-a-raspberry-pi/" title="software PWM (pulse width modulation) library">software PWM (pulse width modulation) library</a> for Raspberry Pi GPIO pins by Mark Williams.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/../images/raspberrypi_ultrasound_brightness.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>For this project you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>1 LED</li>
<li>1 100 Ohm resistor</li>
<li>1 Grove Ultrasound Sensor</li>
<li>5 Male-to-Female Jumper Wires</li>
<li>1 Breadboard</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1.</h3>

<p>Build a simple LED circuit on a breadboard with the 100 Ohm resistor. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Duke University&rsquo;s Selective Living Group for Entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>Back when I was a freshman at Duke, I took the leap of working on my first startup. It was hard and I quickly realized I was swimming in the deep end. I decided to try and find other students who had started companies, so that I could learn as much from them without having to make all the mistakes myself. They were hard to find. Later that year, I stumbled upon a blog post by then Sophomore Sidney Primas where he wrote about his vision for an E-House on Duke&rsquo;s campus, dedicated to building a community of entrepreneurs. I decided to get in touch with Sidney and together with a couple of friends we started what is now The Cube on Duke&rsquo;s campus. As a second semester senior, the time is ripe to reflect on the 4 years invested in building The Cube into the thriving entrepreneurial community it is today.</p>
