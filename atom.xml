    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Right after returning to school in August 2012 from working on WealthLift.com full-time for a year, one of my mentors told me to write down all the lessons I had learned from working on WealthLift. I am very thankful that I took the time to do it, and this is what I wrote. It&rsquo;s not the most organised brain dump, but there are some real gems in here that have now become part of my DNA as a founder.</p>

<h2>1. Your Business Partner is Everything</h2>

<h3>Pick someone you respect in both a personal and professional way</h3>

<p>You will have arguments and bickering. It&rsquo;s really important that you both completely respect one another. Respect each other to tell the truth, even when its  unpleasant, and also enough to judge and weigh each others ideas and arguments with an even hand. <!--more--> It&rsquo;s easy to belittle someone&rsquo;s points if you do not respect the mind behind them.</p>

<p>After all the arguing and discussion, once a decision becomes more or less evident as more right than wrong, you need to respect one another enough to accept the outcome and forget any harsh words or stares and put the issue behind you. Any kind of grudge held against one or the other that is not addressed can dismantle the entire company. Remember, at the beginning, you ARE the company.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/soroush-and-I.png' width='380' height='461' title='The only photo I could find of Soroush and I at our Berlin office'><span class='caption-text'>The only photo I could find of Soroush and I at our Berlin office</span></span></p>

<h3>Pick someone who is as motivated and driven as you are, passionate about the idea</h3>

<p>Again, this is the next 3-5 years we are talking about here. You need to both have a sustained conviction about the importance of the underlying problem you are solving to make it. You might not have the right business model or plan but as long as you are solving a real problem or creating real value for someone, you will eventually figure out how to make the opportunity work.</p>

<p>Emotions in life are like a pendulum and sometimes you are feeling on top of the world and that nothing can stop you and other times, you feel under the weather and that the entire venture is about to fail. You need someone there to can act as a counter balance, over the moon when you aren&rsquo;t and grounded when you&rsquo;re a shooting star. Remember, most ventures fail internally before ever being truly tested by the market. As human beings, we are our first and largest obstacles.</p>

<p>Are you both willing to commit 6 years at the onset? You need to go with the worst case scenario when deciding what to do. Making this decision with the hope of selling in one year for millions wont help you get there, it might happen but the chances are slim.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to marry this person for the next couple years, so take your time with the decision</p>

<p>When excited about the prospects of a new idea, its easy to get so enthralled by it, you want to jump straight into building it! It happens every time. If you are starting the venture with a new or even existing partner, take the time to consider the match. Your business partner is the HARDEST thing to change about your business. The HARDEST. So don&rsquo;t take the decision lightly. Think of it more like dating then just a business, this will seriously put you into the right mindset for choosing your partner.</p>

<h3>Pick someone who compliments you</h3>

<p>This might seem obvious and cliche but you need to think hard about what your strengths and weaknesses are. Get someone who is an opposite to you. For example, at WealthLift I was great at imagining new, useful features and pushing for their implementation. I was not however a perfectionist in the actual implementation. It was very helpful to have Soroush push me to perfect what I would come up with beyond what I initially thought was necessary.</p>

<h2>2. Understand your business</h2>

<h3>A. Do the research</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the Market opportunity?</p></li>
<li><p>Realistically speaking, how much do people currently spend trying to solve this problem?</p></li>
<li><p>How high are the barriers to entry? Is there customer loyalty? Are there costs to the customer for switching?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of a business model can you build around this problem? I am not saying you need to start this way but you need to be aware of the possibilities here.</p></li>
<li><p>Is each customer a one-time buyer or is there the possibility for recurring payments? This will dictate a vastly different per user value for your business.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure not to mistaken the entire restaurant market with the market for italian food in Palo Alto.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage the power of the internet with your idea. Build something that doesn&rsquo;t rely on localisation or physicality. Yes, these are also competitive advantages if you can claim them however the alternative can easily be 5X or 50X an opportunity.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With WealthLift, we blinded ourselves by saying &ldquo;This is a global opportunity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Affiliate deals from Brokerage houses is just our first revenue streams. There are infinite ways to monetize&rdquo;. Neither of those statements were wrong yet&hellip; Just because you have a global opportunity does not mean you wont have to start locally first. You will need to conquer one market before being able to take on the rest. Be sure that you can build a viable business out of one market and do not rely on the elusive size of the world to cover your bottom line. While there are always multiple ways to monetize a business, the preliminary method you choose will be crafted into your product and will be harder to supplant later on. One big problem with the one we chose was that it was a non-recurring revenue stream, forcing us to constantly look for new users without being able to focus at all on driving additional value from our existing user base.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are your competitors?</li>
</ul>


<p>If no one is doing what you want to do, this should be a big red flag. Best is to take an existing industry and bring a large leap forward in the offering. Not only are you sure people are willing to use your product, you also have a strategic exit or at least another company you can acquire once you become the juggernaut in town.</p>

<p>Businesses always look vastly different on the inside then on the outside. One mistake we made with WealthLift was overestimate the amount of money our competitors were making. We thought because of their massive amounts of page views that they were surely making a lot of money. This was not the case. Talk to an insider, someone who knows the organisation to get a real sense of the competition.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are they getting old, loaded down with bureaucracy and inefficiency? Are they unable to move fast? Are they taking advantage of the new ecosystem of the web and mobile? Times are changing quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>How would you improve upon their offering in a way that is meaningful for the user?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your Competitive Advantages? How will you do it better?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Always think in terms of the user. Will they find this improvement significant? Will they be willing to switch for it? Will they stay into the long term? Are you asking them to change their behavior or do you fit into things they already do? Changing behaviors significantly is very difficult.</p>

<h3>B. Don&rsquo;t lie to yourself</h3>

<p>This is probably the hardest thing to do.</p>

<p>No matter how amazing an idea seems, be sure to do yourself a huge favor and take your time understanding it in as much detail as possible. Question every assumption, they each will lead to further assumptions and if a core one is wrong, you will invest time and energy unnecessarily.</p>

<h3>C. Show living proof</h3>

<p>Who can you point to as proof that your idea will work?</p>

<p>What are people already doing around you that could translate into usage of your product?</p>

<p>Look at people&rsquo;s habits, look at the things they do and why to understand where an opportunity exists.</p>

<h3>D. What is your ideas Minimally Viable Product?</h3>

<p>Important is for you to test out your idea as quickly as possible. Developing a product for years before putting it in front of someone is death. Isolate the key features that are most important to your value added offering and focus on those. This will also force you to make a much more concise product and remain focused.</p>

<p>It is always easier to add then to take away from a product. A concise product is also easier to explain and understand.</p>

<p>If your Minimally Viable Product doesn&rsquo;t become an instant hit, don&rsquo;t give up too quickly. The important part of launching a Min Vi is what you learn from it.</p>

<p>First build a Minimally Sticky Product, and then a Minimally Viral Product</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget distribution when building your Minimally Viable Product. Build virality into the product from the onset.</p>

<h3>E. How will you market it?</h3>

<p>There is no such thing as an intrinsically viral product. It must be built into the product.</p>

<p>Think long and hard about which channels you will use to promote your product and how you can succeed in each channel.</p>

<p>Marketing is real work and just as hard as programming so don&rsquo;t let it be an after thought.</p>

<h3>F. How much funding do you need?</h3>

<p>What I learned at WealthLift is two fold. One is that there will always be more unforeseeable costs then you at first think. Second, is that a lot of personal money is not a lot in terms of business money.</p>

<p>Bootstrap for as long as you can before raising a round. Ask friends and family for your first 10-30K to get you up and running with a live product to demo.</p>

<p>At this point raise a seed round that should last you your first year (100-150K). This should help you bring on board some people, market your product and become cash flow positive.</p>

<p>Only once you are making revenues and see the opportunity to accelerate your trajectory, raise from VC&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The best option to bootstrap forever. Raising from investors has been glorified by the press but it can be limiting and the source of many problems for a startup. If you are able to bootstrap your way to profitability, you might want to.</p>

<h2>3. Build modular, clean code</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Coding debt is a real concept. If you don&rsquo;t pay the down payment, it&rsquo;ll bite you in the ass later.</p></li>
<li><p>Build code you can re-use (libraries, hurray!)</p></li>
<li><p>Build code that you could give to a stranger to understand (you wont be writing code forever)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>WRITE DRY CODE: NEVER WRITE THE SAME CODE TWICE</p>

<h2>4. Distribution is EVERYTHING</h2>

<p>Although the first hurdle you will face in starting you company is building the product, it is only the first battle of the war. After this, you need to attract people to your platform and that in itself is another battle.</p>

<p>Build distribution into the platform so that each user can attract another 10 users to the site. Let them invite their friends, broadcast their activity onto Facebook and Twitter. If you have a virality co-efficient of only 1.1, you will eventually see exponential growth.</p>

<p>Think long and hard about Programming Marketing / Growth Hacking (a sustainable, large scale marketing approach)</p>

<h2>5. Communicate your Vision</h2>

<p>You need to be LOUD!</p>

<p>You need to communicate what you are doing with everyone inside your company and outside of it. Unexpected opportunities will spring up by telling people about what you are doing.</p>

<p>Get feedback, answer questions, be useful to others</p>

<p>Write a blog, answer quora/stackoverflow questions, become an expert in your industry.</p>

<p>Email reporters who write about your industry and give them a fresh perspective, additional insight. Seek to be helpful.</p>

<p>Remind your employees to think of the long term, to do things properly and make them feel like a part of something bigger then themselves.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-28T14:16:39-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://fabioberger.github.io/blog/2014/09/28/building-the-inmoov-humanoid-robot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Discovery</h2>

<p>After discovering upon Gael&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.inmoov.fr/" title="InMoov Project">InMoov Project</a>, I decided to start building the InMoov Humanoid Robot. It&rsquo;s been an extremely great learning experience and by far the largest hardware project I have ever undertaken. There were so many lessons learned from this project and so I wanted to share them here with you. Below is a video of the arm Soroush, Alex, Doug and I were able to build within 2 months.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6JMuzcy1dyk " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<h2>Lesson 1: 3D printing is still craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Despite being able to download the exact files of each individual part of the robotic arm, every persons printer has slightly different levels of precision when printing. <!--more--> Because of this, it still took quite a bit of filing and adjusting to get the parts to work together perfectly. Dealing with printer idiosyncrasies was another point of fine tuning and adjustment that turned what I thought would feel like assembling legos into more like handcrafting a violin.</p>

<p> <span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/alex-assembly.png' width='380' height='461' title='Alex Helping Out On Hand Assembly'><span class='caption-text'>Alex Helping Out On Hand Assembly</span></span></p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Each additional moving part is another potential point of failure</h2>

<p>As the complexity of the arm grew and we were hooking up additional servos, gears and potentiometers, so did the number of potential points of failure. Unlike writing code, we couldn&rsquo;t assume a completed part of our project wouldn&rsquo;t change without us changing it, the physical world had other plans in mind. Multiple times, a piece would break, a potentiometer would stop working or a motor would get disconnected and what followed was a painful process of figuring what had gone wrong and who the culprit was.</p>

<h2>Lesson 3: If they say use ABS, use ABS</h2>

<p>Gael specified that the InMoov is best printed using ABS plastic. The reasons are that ABS is stronger and less brittle when compared with PLA. Since I was a proud owner of a Marketbot Replicator 2, ABS proved difficult to print. I decided to go ahead with PLA and experienced first hand how quickly small gears loose their teeth when under stress. Not only this but pieces cracking under the strain became a regular occurrence.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/gear.jpg' width='500' height='447' title='This bugger is tiny and got stripped 5 times'><span class='caption-text'>This bugger is tiny and got stripped 5 times</span></span></p>

<h2>Lesson 4: Hardware is still expensive</h2>

<p>When we started off on this endeavour, I thought I would be able to build this arm for around $200-300, once all the parts (and replacement parts) were bought, not to say anything of the tools we didn&rsquo;t know we needed, the cost of the arm was closer to $500. Because of this, you want to make it so that every piece you assemble can easily be re-used for another purpose. Supergluing servos to your 3D printed parts is probably not a great idea. Your prototype might only be version 1 and it would be great to re-use all those expensive components for version 2.</p>

<p>I hope these lessons learned come in handy as you embark on a 3D printing, hardware project of your own! If you do end up building something, tell me about it!</p>

    <link href="http://fabioberger.github.io/blog/2013/12/27/Open-Source-Humanoid-Robotics/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-27T07:59:12-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://fabioberger.github.io/blog/2013/12/27/Open-Source-Humanoid-Robotics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Birth</h2>

<p>Until this point in time, the development of humanoid robotics has taken place in the R&amp;D centers of large organizations. The reason for this has been the extraordinary cost of the hardware, software and collaboration tools at their disposal. Let&rsquo;s face it, a humanoid robot is an incredibly complex piece of engineering. Every joint, every muscle, not to mention the myriad of cognitive functions that are to be reproduced in a semi-intelligible robot are overwhelming. In order to tackle this challenge, I believe the only way to successfully do so is to tap into the ingenuity of the masses, to enable mass collaboration like that which has never before been possible.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/inmoov.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<p>We are about to enter into an era of unprecedented collaboration. The open source movement which began in the obscure corners of the internet, on IRC channels and email-lists is getting exponentially better at enabling people to find interesting projects, contribute with minimal additional effort and most importantly, is no longer limited to software.</p>

<!--more-->


<h4>The Enablers of Open Source</h4>

<ul>
<li>Github (Software)</li>
<li>Circuits.io &amp; CircuitLab (Hardware &amp; Circuit Printing)</li>
<li>Thingiverse &amp; Cubehero (Physical Design)</li>
</ul>


<p>As is noticable about this list, we have now covered all the broad bases needed for an open-source humanoid robotics project to take hold. With this new approach to building a humanoid robot, we can take unprecedented advantage of budding roboticists from around the globe to help contribute to a singular effort. Are you a 3D parts designer? Fantastic, we have limbs that need to be improved in order to increase range of motion and studiness. Are you a hardware hacker? Great! We need to choose a motor capable of holding the robots weight during biped locomotion. Are you a software guy? Awesome, you&rsquo;ll be right at home, building the layers of abstraction on top of the hardware to make this robot come to life.</p>

<h2>An Analogy: The RepRap Project</h2>

<p>The RepRap project was founded in 2005 with the mission of building an entirely open-source 3D Printer. Because of its open nature, the RepRap project soon began finding collaborators beyond its research lab at Bath University, and it&rsquo;s 3D printers received incremental improvements from collaborators across the globe.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/reprap.jpg" width="500" height="335"></p>

<p>4 years after it&rsquo;s founding, a little known start-up called MakerBot incorporated with the goal of making a commercially available 3D printer. One of its founders, <a href="http://www.zachhoeken.com/about" title="Zach Smith">Zach Smith</a> was an early member and contributor of the RepRap project. Originally a web developer in New York, Smith got interested in 3D printing and decided to join NYC Resistor, a NY hacker space and began learning about hardware. Less then a year later, he was approached by Brett Pettis and began working on MakerBot, a company whose designs were completely open source at the time and based largely on the RepRap project. Makertbot is now one of the largest 3D printer manufacturers and was recently acquired by Stratys for $403 million in stock. Both the success of the RepRap project, an open-source hardware and software initiative as well as the commercial opportunities that can ensue from an open-source foundation have now been shown.</p>

<h2>The Opportunity</h2>

<p>With the surge of 3D printers in circulation, especially amongst makers and hackers, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109466702837468444192/posts" title="Gael Langevin">Gael Langevin</a> put his straight to work at building a robotic hand. Once he had completed that, he just kept going, designing the necessary scaffoldings and hardware more two arms, a head and a torso in what became the <a href="http://www.inmoov.fr/" title="InMoov Project">InMoov Project</a>. The project is completely open source and currently has 50 known reproductions of the Robot out in the world. Together with his collaborators, Gael is continuing to build this robot both in terms of its design, hardware and software with collaborators across the globe.</p>

<p>Just like the early days of the RepRap project, InMoov is still building the first version of its humanoid robot. A commercial product based on it&rsquo;s work has not yet happened, let alone kits for self-assembly by enthusiasts. It is the very early days of a project that can eventually lead to a $3000-5000 dollar humanoid robot. As an open, hackable platform, its potential is endless. Once the physical body has been built, with its skeleton and motorized parts, a software operating system to control it will be needed. This piece of software, in order to be extremely powerful and flexible will need layers of abstraction above the hardware in order to enable the millions of purely software developers who currently build apps for smart phone and tablets, to shift their efforts towards the opportunities presented by a humanoid robotics platform. Instead of accessing GPS, a gyroscope and a camera, they will have access to an entire new array of hardware compenents. Hands, arms, legs, auditory and visual input that can inform programmable physical behavior. The opportunities will be staggering.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/ipad_control.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<p>I am very excited about the future of open source hardware and it&rsquo;s potential to turn our world on its head. If you are too, please reach out!</p>

    <link href="http://fabioberger.github.io/blog/2013/12/21/controlling-led-brightness-with-a-grove-ultrasound-sensor-and-raspberry-pi/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-21T09:26:13-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://fabioberger.github.io/blog/2013/12/21/controlling-led-brightness-with-a-grove-ultrasound-sensor-and-raspberry-pi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently started hacking my Raspberry Pi, and as someone who feels most at home in software, I was delighted to find myself controlling hardware components over an SSH connection and having the entirety of the web at my disposal.</p>

<p>I decided to build a simple project that would use a Grove Ultrasound sensor I had bought. I decided on controlling the brightness of an LED by moving my hand up and down above the ultrasound sensor. To do this, I started with the <a href="https://github.com/yexiaobo-seeedstudio/Grove-RaspberryPi" title="Grove Ultrasound sensor github">Grove Ultrasound Sensor python code</a> off Github as well as a <a href="http://marks-space.com/2013/09/23/software-pwm-on-a-raspberry-pi/" title="software PWM (pulse width modulation) library">software PWM (pulse width modulation) library</a> for Raspberry Pi GPIO pins by Mark Williams.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/raspberrypi_ultrasound_brightness.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>For this project you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>1 LED</li>
<li>1 100 Ohm resistor</li>
<li>1 Grove Ultrasound Sensor</li>
<li>5 Male-to-Female Jumper Wires</li>
<li>1 Breadboard</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1.</h3>

<p>Build a simple LED circuit on a breadboard with the 100 Ohm resistor. <!--more--> Once you have done this, hook up the ground and power of the breadboard to the ground pin and GPIO pin 7 of the Raspberry Pi respectivley. The pins below are labeled using the orientation of the Raspberry Pi in the image above.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/raspberrypi_gpio_pins.png" width="500" height="335"></p>

<h3>Step 2.</h3>

<p>Hook up the Grove Ultrasound sensor connectors with the following labels:</p>

<ul>
<li>VCC to the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>GND to the ground line on the breadboard</li>
<li>SIG to Raspberry Pi GPIO 11</li>
<li>NC remains unconnected</li>
</ul>


<p> <img class="center" src="http://fabioberger.github.io/../images/grove_sensor.png" width="400"></p>

<h3>Step 3.</h3>

<p>Now we need to install Mark Williams PWM software on our Raspberry Pi.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/mwilliams03/pi-blaster.git
</span><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>pi-blaster
</span><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>make pi-blaster
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once we&rsquo;ve done this, we need to enable PWM on GPIO pin 7 in order to control the LED brightness. We do this by specifying pin 7 as an argument in the following call:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ./pi-blaster/pi-blaster 7
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As Mark explains, this starts the pi blaster as a background job. If you ever want to stop it from running, you run the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>sudo killall pi-blaster
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Now we need to grab the code I wrote based on the Grove Ultrasound Sensor python script. I&rsquo;ve modified the script to adjust the LED brightness based on the distance measured by the sensor. The closer ones hand is, the dimmer the LED becomes. In order to control the brightness of the LED, we need to write to /dev/pi-blaster specifying the pin and the brightness between 0 (off) and 1 (full brightness).</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>git clone git@github.com:fabioberger/raspberrypi-ultrasound-led-brightness.git
</span><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ./raspberrypi-ultrasound-led-brightness
</span><span class='line'>pi@raspberrypi ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>sudo python main.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Given that the pi-blaster was setup in the previous step, this should begin the measurements by the ultrasound sensor. Move your hand up and down above the sensor and watch the LED brightness adjust!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this walk through!</p>

<p>Back when I was a freshman at Duke, I took the leap of working on my first startup. It was hard and I quickly realized I was swimming in the deep end. I decided to try and find other students who had started companies, so that I could learn as much from them without having to make all the mistakes myself. They were hard to find. Later that year, I stumbled upon a blog post by then Sophomore Sidney Primas where he wrote about his vision for an E-House on Duke&rsquo;s campus, dedicated to building a community of entrepreneurs. I decided to get in touch with Sidney and together with a couple of friends we started what is now The Cube on Duke&rsquo;s campus. As a second semester senior, the time is ripe to reflect on the 4 years invested in building The Cube into the thriving entrepreneurial community it is today.</p>

<h3>People are Everything</h3>

<p>When we began recruiting our first class we had no idea where we would find our first 15 members. We were able to recruit my then co-founder but after that small win, <!--more--> the two other founders we knew on campus turned us down as they were not convinced of the value we would bring to them, instead of seeing the opportunity and impact they could have on others. We therefore had to switch gears towards pitching the general student body about the merits of startups and why they would want to be a part of The Cube.</p>

<p>Many events later, we had convinced a small but significant group of apply. After interviewing them all, we decided to take almost everyone who had applied. Some of those who applied had an idea and were on their way to building their startups but by and large these were students intruiged with entrepreneurship. Some would later blossom into incredible founders while most would eventually drop from The Cube realizing that startups was not for them.</p>

<p>Over the last 4 years, The Cube has had an attrition rate fo 80% and I am constantly reminded of the fact that startups are not for everyone. Some of our members were too enamored with academia to put themselves through the load of grunt work every startup requires. Others we later found out saw The Cube as merely resume fluff that would make them look more &ldquo;entrepreneurial&rdquo; for employers (Yuck!). And still others just didn&rsquo;t feel ready to take the leap, throw their weight behind their idea and give it a go. Instead of trying to resist this, I have found that you cannot convince someone to be a founder.</p>

<p>As a selective living group, our greatest asset as a group are our members. This has reminded me again that every organization is only as great as the people who make it up. This cannot be understated. We have therefore evolved our recruiting strategy into a very selective process that tries to give us a wholistic view of a person prior to membership. We want to get a sense of a persons ability to achieve, willingness to learn and personality. These are the three dimensions for a person that will inform us whether they will not only a great founder but a great InCuber. InCubers are a subset of founders, they are founders who are willing to help, mentor and collaborate with other founders for the betterment of everyone in the entrepreneurial community.</p>

<h3>Know your mission</h3>

<p>At The Cube we have been constantly defining our mission as an organization. Are we a social group for entrepreneurs, an incubator, an aggregator of startup resources, all of the above? It has taken us a while to figure this out but now that it has taken shape, it has given us a laser focus that can guide all our activities.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Cube is a community of student entrepreneurs who support one another through mentorship, advice and friendship.</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of replicating many of the startup resources available online or by Duke, The Cube has to focus on perhaps the most important resource for a founder: their support network. Startups are hard and it&rsquo;s when things are not working out or when you&rsquo;re feeling down that you need the most support. Having role models, others you can go to who have gone through what you are experiencing, offer useful advice and be there for you as a friend is priceless. This year I had the immense pleasure of living with Devin Solanki, founder of <a href="http://powerhouseprotein.com/" title="Powerhouse">PowerHouse Protein</a>. Not only have we become great friends, he has taught me an incredibe amount about manufacturing and selling physical products, while in return I helped introduce him to e-commerce and online ads as a way to boost his sales. It is these kinds of exchanges that exemplify The Cube&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<h3>Personal relationships are paramount</h3>

<p>When we first began, we did not realize how important it was for members of The Cube to be great friends first a foremost. In order to become invested in one anothers startups and truly want one another to succeed you first have to spend a lot of time with a person and become invested in their well being. Once we had realized that, we began to focus much more on organizing social events, getting members to party together and make The Cube not only a formal commitment you have decided to partake in but also a group of friends you hang out with on friday night.</p>

<p>The effects have been dramatic. Not only do members now know one another more intimately and therefore constantly have an eye out for opportunities, individuals and information that could help the startups of others, there has been a much greater involvement from members in the group. Members feel emotionally attached to the group and the friendships that hold it together and this is a solid foundation that will allow The Cube to flourish.</p>
